WebIsADb is a publicly available database containing more than 400 million hypernymy relations we extracted from the CommonCrawl web corpus. This collection of relations represents a rich source of knowledge and may be useful for many researchers. We offer the tuple dataset for public download and an application programming interface to help other researchers programmatically query the database.

This software is meant to be part of the CommonCrawl framework: http://commoncrawl.org/ 
to re-build a new WebIsADb from fresh CommonCrawl dumps.
